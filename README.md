# Road Accident Dashboard
Excel dashboard analyzing Total Casualties by Vehicle Type 🛵🚗🚌🚚  This interactive dashboard provides a comprehensive look at how different types of vehicles contribute to road casualties.
The goal was to create a tool that’s not just informative—but also interactive and visually compelling.

🔍 Key Highlights: ✅ Dynamic slicers to filter by year and vehicle type
✅ Clear, interactive visuals for quick insights
✅ Summary cards showing total casualties and top contributors
✅ Trend analysis to identify patterns across time
✅ Built entirely in Excel using formulas, pivot tables, and charts—no add-ins!

This dashboard is a great example of how Excel can go beyond basic spreadsheets and become a powerful tool for storytelling and data-driven decision-making.

💡 It was a fun learning experience that strengthened my skills in data visualization, cleaning, and dashboard design.
